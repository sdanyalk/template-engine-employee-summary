# CI/CD

CI/CD means Continuous Integration / Continous Development. This is a development practice that means deploying your code as soon as you develop it automatically.

I'm using [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/) for this. It is very easy to setup and use. You will need to create a file called `.travis.yml` at the root of your project. After that go to [github marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) to add travis-ci to your github. It also gives nice build badges that can be added to the readme.
