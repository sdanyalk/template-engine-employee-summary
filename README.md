This is the solution for homework assignment-10 of University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. As an instructor, I have provided my solution as guidance to my students. I have licensed this code under [MIT license](license), which means that if you use any code from here, you will need to reference the copyright **exactly** as it is. Even after doing that, if you try to submit your homework using any code from here, it will be considered **plagarism**.
